My research interest is about the 3D user interface design of mixed reality, computer graphics and animation. My current research focuses on problems in interdisciplinary fields. Specifically, within the virtual reality (VR) and human-computer interaction (HCI) areas, some user interfaces are designed to solve some social good problems, such as healthcare, education, training and learning, social behavior and motion sickness.<br/>Outside the research scope, I'm also interested in anime, film, the design and creation of art, game design, sketching, digital painting and photographing.

## Ongoing Research
#### VR Authentication: Cognitive Methods of Memorization
<img style="width: 120px; height: 90px; float: left; margin-right: 15px; padding: 1px" src="/assets/img/dba-teaser.png">

This research aims to evaluate the efficiency, memorability and security of three different VR authentication methods and explore the cognitive methods of memorizing passwords. Participants will be asked to memorize three types of passwords consisting of symbols, visual contexts and a combination of the two methods respectively. A within-subject design is onling.

#### Nurse Training in Virtual Reality
<img style="width: 120px; height: 90px; float: left; margin-right: 15px; padding: 1px" src="/assets/img/nurse-training.png">

This research aims to facilitate nurse students to improve technical knowledge and proficiency with objective of procedural skills training. The simulated scenarios for this project include chest pain treatment and oxygen therapy. Experiments are being performed to evaluate the feasibility, user acceptance and the effectiveness of using this customized simulation.
