My research interest is about the 3D user interface design of mixed reality, computer graphics and animation. My current research focuses on problems in interdisciplinary fields. Specifically, within the virtual reality (VR) and human-computer interaction (HCI) areas, some user interfaces are designed to solve some social good problems, such as healthcare, education, training and learning, social behavior and motion sickenss.<br/>Outside the research scope, I'm also interested in anime, film, the design and creation of art, game design, sketching, digital painting and photographing.

## Ongoing Research
#### Nurse Training in Virtual Reality
<img style="width: 120px; height: 90px; float: left; margin-right: 15px" src="/assets/img/nurse-training.png">
This project aims to facilitate nurse students to improve technical knowledge and proficiency with objective of procedural skills training. The simulated scenario for this project is the chest pain. Experiments to be performed to evaluate the effectiveness and learning outcomes of using VR in chest pain training.
