My research focuses on 3D user interface design in mixed reality, addressing interdisciplinary challenges. Specifically, within the fields of virtual reality (VR) and human-computer interaction (HCI), I design user interfaces to tackle social good issues, such as virtual humans, healthcare, education, training and learning, social behavior, and motion sickness.
Beyond my research, I have a strong interest in anime, film, art design and creation, sketching, digital painting, and photography.

## Ongoing Research
#### Knee Surgery in VR
<img style="width: 120px; height: 90px; float: left; margin-right: 15px; padding: 1px" src="/assets/img/knee-survery-demo.png">

This research aims to develop a virtual reality (VR) training system for knee surgery simulation. In collaboration with knee surgeons, we integrated an automatic pause module at each step, presenting relevant medical knowledge through videos while highlighting the appropriate instruments for interaction, enhanced by haptic feedback and visual cues.

#### Nurse Training in Virtual Reality
<img style="width: 120px; height: 90px; float: left; margin-right: 15px; padding: 1px" src="/assets/img/nurse-training.png">

This research aims to facilitate nurse students to improve technical knowledge and proficiency with objective of procedural skills training. The simulated scenarios for this project include chest pain treatment and oxygen therapy. Two user studies have been performed to evaluate the feasibility, user acceptance and effectiveness of using this customized simulation to evaluate nurse competency.

#### Direction-Based Authentication: Combining Symbolic Input and Contextual Cues for Virtual Reality Password Entry.
<img style="width: 120px; height: 90px; float: left; margin-right: 15px; padding: 1px" src="/assets/img/dba-ismar.png">

This research aims to evaluate the efficiency, memorability and security of three different VR authentication methods and explore the cognitive methods of memorizing passwords. Specifically, we proposed a method called Direction-Based Authentication (DBA) that combines the context and symbol information together.
